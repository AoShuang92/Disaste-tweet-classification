# Disaste-tweet-classification
This repo is about the project in Kaggle "Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets"(https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started). I have tried three models in my code: without LSTM, with LSTM and refined LSTM, with accuracy of 0.496, 0.773 and 0.780 respectively. 
I seperated the train.csv file into train and validation datafile for cross validation.
