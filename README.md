# Disaste-tweet-classification
This repo is about the project in Kaggle <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started">"Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets"</a>.<br>
I have tried three models in my code: without LSTM, with LSTM and refined LSTM version, with test accuracy of 0.496, 0.773 and 0.780 respectively.<br> 
I seperated the train.csv file into train (0.8) and validation (0.2) data for cross validation. The validation accuracy with refined LSTM model is 0.81.
